# An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of
# each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an
# XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has
# an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which
# returns the node at index.
#
# If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you
# have access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions that converts
# between nodes and memory addresses.


# !!! IMPORTANT !!!
# Unfortunately, I am coding in Python, and want my code to work. I wont be
# doing this problem in Python, but I will most likely come back to it in C++
