# You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum
# number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from
# top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is
# lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each
# row itself is ordered lexicographically.
# 
# For example, given the following table:
# 
# cba
# daf
# ghi
